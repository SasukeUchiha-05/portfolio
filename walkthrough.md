# Portfolio Walkthrough

I have successfully built a professional, animated portfolio website for **Vijay Sai Karthik Motiki**.

## Features Implemented
- **Hero Section**: Animated entrance, "Full-Stack Developer specializing in AI" title, and particles background.
- **About Section**: Detailed summary extracted from the resume.
- **Experience Section**: Timeline view of work history (NR Consulting, CodeNovate).
- **Projects Section**: Grid layout displaying projects (Transport Services LLM, Research-Agent, etc.) with tech stacks.
- **Skills Section**: Categorized skills (Languages, Backend, Frontend, AI/ML, Cloud).
- **Contact Section**: Links to Email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Phone.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive on mobile and desktop with a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
- **Animations**: Smooth scrolling, fade-in effects on scroll, and interactive hover states.

## Verification
I verified the website by opening `index.html` in the browser.
- **Navigation**: Clicking links scrolls smoothly to the respective sections.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes.
- **Animations**: Elements fade in as you scroll down.
